# BBBasic (Backbone Basic)#
 
## Simple App Design ##
  > A module designed to help budding young developers with no prior Backbone experience

## Summary ##
  > Get started with a few basic templates representing the major MVC components for a functional app.

## Problem ##
  > To take the confusion out of what's required to initialize and deploy a minimal website using the Backbone framework.

## Solution ##
  > Provides a few basic Models and Views with an index.html. The instantiation and representation of each are already coded for you along with comments on how they tie together to ultimately render a fully adjustable website with base functionality.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Simply run `npm install bbbasic` and download the module to get access. 
  > Then require `bbbasic` in your js files.

## Closing Comments ##
  > After adjusting the templates to fit the individual needs of your app, get your server up and running and deploy to a service like [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/) or [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/start) to complete the process.
